"The findings from the 2020 monitoring report show that since the Development Strategy was adopted, new dwelling consents are in fact delivering a more quality compact city: from the 14,776 dwellings that were consented in 2019/2020, 82% were in the existing urban area."
"The adaptive reuse approach retained 68% of the building’s structure, which reduced the need for virgin material extraction and retained a part of the tower’s embodied CO2 equivalent to 10,000 flights from Sydney to Melbourne. In doing so, the renovation was able to reduce its contribution to the overexploitation of natural resources and to climate change, thereby minimising the project’s impact on biodiversity."
"The application of circular economy principles in the building’s design goes further as its structure was designed for disassembly by joining the timber components using screws instead of glue. This means the building can be taken apart simply by unscrewing the components, which can then be reused in other projects. The office is also conceived as a materials bank, with all its materials monitored using a public online repository so they can more easily be reused in the future. Built in 2019, the building achieved a BREEAM Outstanding Certificate for its environmental, social, and economic sustainability thanks to, among other factors, making use of sustainable materials and natural light, and carefully regulating its climate."
"Using timber instead of concrete as a renewable, low-carbon material allowed for the Believe in Better Building to reduce its dependency on the extraction of finite resources like sand and gravel, which has been associated with detrimental effects to biodiversity. The structure locks in 1,242 tonnes of CO2, even after discounting the 200 tonnes of emissions associated with manufacturing and transporting the timber from Austria. This is equivalent to 12 years of regulated operational carbon or 6 years of total operational carbon."
"Using hemp instead of concrete as a renewable, low-carbon material allowed for the Flat House to reduce its dependency on the extraction of finite resources like sand and gravel, which are associated with detrimental effects on biodiversity. The renewable materials and offsite construction methods used allowed to radically reduce the building’s embodied carbon. Moreover, hemp captures carbon as it grows, absorbing it from our atmosphere and locking it into biomass. As a result, the project is estimated to have negative annual emissions of –2.32 kgCO2/m²."
"Villa Welpeloo’s use of salvaged instead of virgin materials displaced the need for further natural resource extraction, processing, and disposal. Reusing existing materials minimized the construction’s contribution to the key direct drivers of biodiversity loss, such as climate change and overexploitation of natural resources."
"The circular economy approach to retaining and reusing as much of the existing frame and façade as possible saved 3,300m2  of limestone, 35,000 tonnes of concrete and 1,900 tonnes of steel. By doing so, the project avoided the impacts on biodiversity of extracting and processing such amounts of virgin resources. This approach also minimised the carbon footprint of the redevelopment, hence reducing its contribution to climate change - one of the key drivers of biodiversity loss. Compared to a typical new build alternative, the building has been estimated to achieve a 54% carbon saving in construction and operation, equivalent to the annual energy consumption of over 10,000 UK homes."
"By making use of local, existing materials, this Danish development reduced the need for virgin material extraction and processing — hence limiting its impact on natural resource overexploitation and climate change, two of the key drivers of biodiversity loss. Additionally, the design for flexibility approach taken for interior spaces will help keep the buildings in use for longer, even under changing requirements."

"Global chemical company Solvay supplies high-performance plastics, polymers, fluids, and elastomers to a range of other industries. In 2020, Solvay launched its One Planet sustainability strategy, with a commitment to protecting the climate, preserving resources, and fostering better life. As part of this programme, the firm committed to reducing their pressure on biodiversity by 30% by 2030. Through ReCiPe, a biodiversity impact assessment tool, they identified the areas where their operations and supply chain generated the largest pressures on biodiversity. They concluded greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater eutrophication, marine ecotoxicity and soil acidification represent around 90% of their potential impacts on biodiversity. In addition to phasing out polluting energy sources, Solvay is aiming at reducing the impact on these critical areas through a scale up of their circular economy efforts."
"DS Smith is an international packaging company and integrated recycling services provider. It operates in 17 countries to manage over 5 million tonnes of recyclable materials each year and ensure they are kept in the system. The company supports innovation in its business model to include circular design projects for packaging and improve collection systems in urban areas. Its sustainability strategy sets several commitments, including scaling their circular economy efforts to tackle the biodiversity crisis. For example, a key on-going action to reduce the firm’s pressures on biodiversity is favouring recycling over virgin fibres, in order to minimise extraction of new materials and leave more room for conservation efforts. DS Smith is also starting to explore ways to measure and improve biodiversity in the 14,000 hectares of forest it owns in North America, Portugal and Spain by 2025."
"Arvometsä is a Finnish forestry services provider helping forest owners get more value out of their lands while retaining their biodiversity and recreational services. They provide forest planning, felling, and acquiring services, in-line with continuous cover forestry management approaches. In continuous cover forestry, only the largest trees in the forest are cut, either because they are at the ideal size for harvesting, or to make more space for the smaller commercial ones to grow. In this way, clear-felling is avoided, and the forest is able to retain its structure and continue to provide important habitats for many species. This practice allows the forest to regenerate itself without external inputs, displacing the need for expensive investments in seedlings, planting, and upkeep. At the same time, the forests generate revenue more frequently for their owners as trees are harvested every 15-25 years, compared to the 80 years it takes to complete a full growth cycle in an even-aged forest."
"Klabin, Brazil’s biggest paper producer and exporter, has developed a “mosaic forest management system” where pine and eucalyptus trees are planted in blocks and mixed with native preserved trees. In between, ecological corridors are preserved to allow animals to transit. This practice helps to preserve fauna, flora, and water resources from the Atlantic Forest biome. In these preserved native forests, Klabin has also implemented a programme that allows the company to grow and harvest non-timber products, such as medicinal plants."
"Schneider Electric has committed to zero net biodiversity loss in their direct operations by 2030.  The Global Biodiversity Score, assessing the group’s value chain impact on biodiversity, found that most of the pressures on natural ecosystems were related to their greenhouse gas emissions and land use. With a better understanding of their impact, they were able to prioritise which actions to take to meet their biodiversity ambition. Their new biodiversity strategy emphasises on advancing their circular economy efforts through using fewer natural resources to reduce their climate impact and leave room for nature. For instance, one of the key circular opportunities for Schneider Electric is the retrofit solution, ECOFIT™. This program was developed to facilitate equipment upgrades by replacing only certain key components, rather than the whole system. In this way, they can keep products in use for longer, reducing both their demand for new materials and their climate impact."
"Natura & Co produces a wide range of cosmetics, including soaps, creams and shampoos that rely on the rich biodiversity of the Amazon for ingredients. Their supply chain includes almost 40 types of plant-derived ingredients. To source these, Natura – among other suppliers – works with about 7,000 local families with traditional knowledge and combines it with advanced research to innovate. Natura's business model supports the 'standing forest' economy model, which is based on the idea that a tree has much more value standing up than being cut down."
"The development of 20 townhouses in Ørestad, a district in Copenhagen, was marked by the use of repurposed and recycled materials. Lehander Group, the Danish architecture studio behind the Upcycled Studios project, aimed to use as many existing, locally-available materials as possible. For example, through a collaboration with Dinesen, the wood for floors, walls and façades was recovered from offcuts that would otherwise have been sent to landfill or incinerated, avoiding the impact on biodiversity of such disposal methods. Moreover, 75% of the double-glazed windows were recovered from disused buildings in North Jutland, Denmark; and 1,400 tons (~1,270 tonnes) of concrete were recycled from the waste generated by the construction of Copenhagen Metro. The townhouses also make use of roof gardens and solar panels to increase their self-sufficiency, as well as flexible interiors — ensuring that the space could easily be adapted in the future according to the users’ changing needs."
"1 Triton Square, London, was purpose-built for the First National Bank of Chicago in 1997. Twenty years after it was completed, new workstyles and performance standards prompted an upgrade of the space. The typical way of doing so would have involved demolishing and constructing a new building. Instead, through an expansive reuse approach, Arup proposed keeping as much of the existing structure and façade as possible, adding three extra floors to double office space while minimising the environmental footprint of the building’s upgrade. This circular approach offered many benefits: the refurbishment of the façade for instance not only saved 1,270 tonnes of carbon but also offered a 66% cost saving against a like for like replacement. The new design, completed in early 2021, is set to provide a healthy, flexible workplace to 4,000 people as well as retail units and a gym."
"Villa Welpeloo is a house in the Netherlands constructed from 60% salvaged material. For instance, steel was sourced from machinery previously used in textile production, a once prominent industry in the Enschede region of the Netherlands, where the house is located. The wood used in the façade was taken from 200 damaged cable reels, which gave pieces of a uniform size and shape. This wood would traditionally be turned into particleboard or worse incinerated, effectively shortcutting the usefulness of the material and contributing to climate change, a key direct driver of biodiversity loss. Across all of their projects, Superuse Studio’s aim is “to change the process of design and construction in a way that it would use much less resources and optimally benefit from what a construction site and surroundings have to offer.” In this way, the desire to salvage materials leads to their design process being conducted in parallel with the materialisation process. In the case of Villa Welpeloo, an awareness of the resources available locally aided by using Google Earth’s technology influenced the way the architects actually designed the building."
"Flat House is a 100m2 house designed by Practice Architecture using hemp-based materials as an alternative to the finite resources typically used in the construction industry. Located in Margent Farm,  a 21-hectares hemp farming facility in England, the building makes use of the renewable materials grown on-site. Prefabricated timber panels were filled with hempcrete — a mixture of hemp shiv, lime, and water — to create highly insulated walls. The walls were raised into place in two days. Then, hemp fibre-based corrugated sheets were fixed onto the structure. The collaboration needed for the rapid, low-impact construction of this three-bedroom house led to the establishment of Material Cultures, a research organisation working with Margent Farm, Arup, UAL, UCL and others to explore ways to scale up the usage of biobased materials and offsite construction methods in the industry."
"The Believe in Better Building is the tallest commercial timber building in the UK, demonstrating the potential of switching to renewable materials in the built environment. The structure houses Sky’s training and development suite, office space for more than 200 employees, and is a venue for community events and school visits. Instead of typical construction materials, the project made use of wood due to its potential to not only reduce emissions but also sequester carbon. Additional circular economy strategies used to reduce the environmental impact of the building included prefabrication, which shortened the build time considerably, and designing for adaptability, so that spaces would remain useful to users over the long-term. Overall, the building achieved a BREEAM ‘Excellent’ environmental rating, yet it was delivered within the cost of a traditional commercial office building."
"Designed by RAU Architects, the timber-based structure of Triodos Bank’s new headquarters in the Netherlands demonstrates the potential of switching to renewable materials as an alternative to finite, greenhouse gas-intensive raw materials. The five-storey office building, with a surface of 12,994m2, contains 1,615m3 of laminated wood, over 1,000m3 of cross-laminated wood (CLT) and five tree trunks. Only the basement uses concrete due to the high-water table. The timber for the structure came from a German manufacturer using spruce from PEFC-certified managed European forests*."
"Quay Quarter Tower, originally built in 1976, has been the centrepiece of Sydney’s harbour area revitalisation. Since 2018, the building has been undergoing a redevelopment which will see a height increase, the construction of additional floorspace, and a modernisation of the building’s entire design. Instead of demolishing and constructing a new building, which usually occurs with any major urban development and leads to waste generation and resource demand, Arup and Danish architects 3XN took an adaptive reuse approach to convert the existing building and prepare it for a new use."
"Historically, Auckland’s growth has been linked to urban sprawl: converting rural and biodiversity-rich natural areas into low-density urban environments, which favoured a high-emissions, car-dependent transport system. Current projections show that by 2050 the region could need over 313,000 more dwellings to accommodate 2.4 million people, up from 1.66 million in 2018. Aware of the environmental, social and economic issues of past sprawl, the metropolitan region’s council released the Auckland Plan 2050 Development Strategy in 2018. Among other goals, the Plan aims to improve residents’ well-being and minimise environmental impact by ensuring that the region’s growth will take “a quality compact approach”. In order to achieve this, the plan favours high rise and high-quality infill developments in existing areas within Auckland's urban footprint, especially around transit corridors and within walkable urban centres."
"Singapore is an example of a city that has adopted a compact and biodiversity-friendly approach to urban planning. Despite its population density increasing from 3,538 residents per km2 in 1970 to 7,810 residents per km2 in 2020, the city managed to expand green areas from 36% to 47% of its total land area. In fact, since the early 1960s, Singapore has had a strong ambition to green itself in order to become a highly liveable and competitive city. For example, high-rise greenery has increasingly become an essential component of the city’s development plan, in part due to the limited amount of land available. The government now requires property developers to replace any greenery lost during construction and covers 50% of the costs of installing green roofs and walls on existing buildings. As a result, the city’s 72 hectares of rooftop gardens and green walls are set to triple by 2030. These, combined with 4,172 hectares of green space (parks and park connectors), reduce the city’s heat-island effect, help absorb stormwater, provide space for recreation, and increase urban biodiversity."
"MIWA provides a complete business ecosystem for smart-powered reuse packaging. Through a refill-on-the-go business model, the Czech company aims to offer a waste-free shopping experience —  eliminating the potential for single-use plastic packaging to pollute natural environments and threaten biodiversity. In 2020, the company’s system was implemented by Nestlé to offer high-tech bulk dispensing solutions for instant coffee and pet food. The system was trialled in three Nestlé shops in Switzerland during a four-month period. The pilot proved itself successful, as most customers said they were satisfied with the experience and, by the end of the pilot, 50% of customers brought their own reusable packaging for refill. As a result, Nestlé scaled the refill solution to 16 shops with its Purina One brand across Switzerland to test operational viability at a larger scale. MIWA is also continuing to advance its reuse solution in the Czech Republic and beyond, including countries like Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Germany and the UK."
"Indonesia is estimated to generate 6.8 million tonnes of plastic waste each year, of which around 4.8 million tonnes are mismanaged and approximately 620,000 tonnes leak into waterways and the ocean every year. Sachets are a common item contributing to plastic leakage in Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries, due to their small size and low value in the recycling market."
"Everdrop offers concentrated cleaning tablets that the customer can mix with water at home in reusable bottles. Once the user has used up the cleaning product, they can order tablets for approximately EUR 1 per refill, meaning Everdrop is cost-competitive in comparison with liquid products packaged in single-use plastic bottles. Founded in Germany in 2019, Everdrop is already present in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy and France. In a funding round completed in early 2021, Everdrop raised EUR 18 million, which they plan to use to develop a wider range of household products and further expand their market across Europe and the US."
"Ooho is an edible and home compostable “blob” for beverages and condiments made from seaweed. It offers an alternative to small flexible packaging used in take-away food and beverages, which has a low recycling value and can leak into the environment, harming biodiversity. Ooho’s potential is being recognised by various market players. For instance, following a successful trial of Lucozade filled Oohos at the 2019 London Marathon, Ooho is being rolled out as the selected hydration solution for Lucozade at running events. They are also partnering with Just Eat, Hellmann’s and Innovate UK to scale the uptake of Ooho as an alternative for plastic condiment sachets throughout the UK. Notpla, the company behind Ooho, is now exploring other applications like seaweed-based takeaway boxes, heat-sealable films, and sachets for non-food products."
"In order to tackle the ubiquity of single-use packaging in food products, Kecipir has developed an online platform to locally deliver fresh fruit and vegetables, connecting farmers directly with urban consumers through a fully reusable, circular delivery system. Produce is first harvested on-demand through an app-based platform that ensures freshness and best quality, enhancing the user experience for consumers. Then, Kecipir helps deliver the produce directly from the farmer to the consumer in reusable crates. Reduced transport distances and a smaller number of parties involved makes the model economically effective. Kecipir’s platform is price competitive as produce can be up to 50% cheaper than supermarket produce, making the model accessible to a wide range of consumers."
"To avoid the need for problematic multi-material packaging, JOI started offering concentrated nut pastes as an alternative to conventional nut milk cartons. This paste can then be mixed with water at home to make nut-based beverages and other products. In this way, JOI has been able to rethink a traditionally liquid product into an innovative solid one. As a result, the packaging requirements for the product changed, now allowing for mono-material, recyclable tubs to be used, as well as providing more servings per container, reducing the overall amount of packaging needed."
"Algramo, a Santiago-based startup, offers affordable quantities of everyday products without single-use packaging, which have a detrimental effect on biodiversity. Targeting economies where recycling infrastructure is limited and packaging items often end up in the environment, Algramo introduces a reusable packaging system involving smart technology, dispensers, and affordable containers. Algramo’s refill-on-the-go system in Santiago has proven resilient to shocks: sales increased by 356% between April and June 2020 while the city was in full lockdown. After their success in Chile, Algramo is working with Walmart, Unilever, Nestlé’s Purina and other players to expand their services and scale up. At the international level, they already have pilot programs in the US and Indonesia, and are looking to enter new markets, including Mexico and the UK."
"Northeastern China is an important agricultural base, and its productivity is largely a result of its nutrient-rich black soil. Full of organic matter and among the most fertile soil, it takes 200 to 400 years to form just 1 cm, and it is nicknamed “panda soil”. However, long term pursuit of productivity has led to the overuse of fertilisers and unsustainable tilling practices, leading to the erosion and degradation of the black soil at a large scale over the years."
"Totomoxtle is a veneer made out of the husks of traditional, colorful, Mexican corn. Designer Fernando Laposse has developed this material and uses it to create a range of furniture and installations with unique tonalities. This offers a high-value application for this inedible byproduct and encourages the cultivation of the native maize varieties that aren't otherwise valued in the market."
"Guayakí sells canned beverages and loose leaves of yerba mate, a traditional plant found in the South American Atlantic rainforest. The company develops long-term partnerships with indigenous producers and smallholder farmers that harvest yerba mate or grow it under the shade of native trees, a method that requires less water than conventional agriculture and helps to regenerate and conserve the land. In areas with forest remnants, Guayakí works to maintain that vegetation, and areas that have been previously used for other purposes, such as growing soy, are restored. Guayakí valorises both the social and the environmental aspect of their business. All yerba mate produced or harvested must be organic certified and producers receive a premium price for the product, which makes it more economically appealing than degenerative alternatives, such as using the land for cutting trees to sell timber or for conventional agriculture. The company works with farmers in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay."
"Native has developed a method for growing sugar cane that replicates the resilient, regenerative ecosystem of uncultivated land, avoiding practices that disturb biodiversity, such as pre-harvest fires. Instead of using chemical fertilisers, they have implemented an Integrated Organic Fertilisation Programme. Pesticides were exchanged for a natural pest and disease management system, which leverages naturally resistant crop varieties, and counts on a biological control programme and cultural control methods to inhibit pests and weeds. Soil compression during harvesting is another potential threat for soil vitality. To avoid this, Native has developed its own harvesting equipment with low pressure tyres. It simultaneously cuts cane and shreds by-products, returning them back to the soil."
"Today, only one-eighth of all wild fish species, such as roach, are made use of in Finland – the “Land of a Thousand Lakes”. Yet 92% of Finns eat fish. Seeing this untapped potential, a cluster of Finnish fishermen, processors and wholesalers are working to make better use of local fish and fish parts. The Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra and the City of Jyväskylä, among others, first helped catalyse the development of this underused resource, through a set of pilot projects. They did this by leveraging the role procurement of local regenerative food, by sharing catch data across the production chain, as well as by innovations in processing equipment and design of attractive commercial food products such as fish patties. The sales of these fish products have been boosted by an online wholesale platform, logistic development, and by emphasising locality in marketing to consumers. And this is only the beginning. In 2021, the Finnish government approved a proposal to grant €1 million to projects (worth €2-3 million), that develop under-utilised fish into food, with the goal of increasing the use by 1 million kg."
"Almost 20% of the global wild marine fish catch is used to make fishmeal and fish oil, of which the vast majority is used to feed other fish cultivated in aquaculture farms. Almost 50% of seafood already comes from aquaculture and the industry is facing growing demand to help feed the growing world population. The reliance on marine-derived feed ingredients could put an increasing pressure on already threatened marine biodiversity."
"reNature supports farmers and corporations in their transition towards regenerative agriculture practices. They focus on promoting regenerative systems that enhance soil health and have a positive carbon footprint. An agricultural system that empowers farmers to become more resilient to climate impacts and less dependent on agrochemicals, is also a more biodiverse, productive and nature-friendly system."
"Brilliant Planet has developed a technology to produce microalgae on land, at a large scale, for the first time. Using only sunlight, sea water, and wind, they operate the largest algae growth pond in the world - thirty-thousand-square meters in size - in the coastal desert of Morocco. They grow local algae varieties adapted to their surroundings, for use in various products ranging from healthy plant-based food rich in protein and Omega 3, to animal feed, and alternative plastics."
"FoodFlow is an organisation working to create a showcase 0% food loss-value chain for fruits and vegetables. They initiate and build local social start-ups in Kenya to fill in the gaps in the value chain from which food is currently being lost. To date, they have four ventures under development in the chain of mangos, avocados and french beans. The ventures seek to:"
"Agricycle works with smallholder farmers around the world to upcycle food that would otherwise be wasted. They design scalable dehydrator technologies that enable food to be preserved for longer, purchase the resulting products directly from cooperatives, and create brands to sell these products in global markets. Farmers benefit by being able to sell more of what they produce and at a higher price. For example, the Jali Fruit Co. brand pays the women in its cooperatives in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean 7 times the average daily local wage, while also providing on-the-job skills training like food safety and financial literacy."
"Community Grains produces organic wholegrain products such as pasta, flour and hearth bread with the aim of restoring a vibrant local grain economy in California. They source a wide array of grain varieties from local farmers that use regenerative practices on their land, and mill the entire grains to retain their essential nutrients and the depth of flavour in the final products. Consumers can access information about any stage of the supply chain of the products they purchase - such as information on the farmer, seed variety, or mill date - to help them make more informed decisions about their food."
"Rizoma Agro is a Brazilian producer, researcher, and technology developer for regenerative organic agriculture. In its 1,200 hectares, it draws on schools of thought like agroforestry and intensive silvopasture (i.e. integrating trees with livestock), and uses practices like crop rotation, and integrated crop-livestock management to produce a wide range of products including corn, soy, oats, beans, citrus, ginger, turmeric, timber, and cattle. In 2019, it became the largest producer of regenerative organic grains and pulses in Brazil and now supplies major food companies like Nestlé and Unilever. By 2030, its goal is to grow organic crops regeneratively on 350,000 hectares in Brazil and to assist other farmers in their transition to regenerative practices."
"GreenWave has developed a polyculture model that grows a mix of seaweed and shellfish called regenerative ocean farming, which allows cultivation to take place whilst enabling biodiversity to prosper. The technique involves suspending a simple structure of ropes and buoys between the sea surface and seabed, on which scallops, clams, oysters, mussels, and seaweeds, are grown at different depths. A mature, twenty acre regenerative ocean farm can produce up to 68 tons (~61.7 tonnes) of nutritious seaweed and 250,000 shellfish. These harvests can be used as ingredients in novel food products - such as the range of seaweed products made by Seamore - processed to create fertiliser or animal feed for the agricultural sector, or transformed into materials for other industries. Studies on seaweed aquaculture more broadly have shown that farming 0.03% of the ocean’s surface area in this way could offer an economic opportunity of USD 500 billion and create 50 million jobs, helping to revitalise local communities that have long relied on the sea for their livelihoods."
"In the fashion industry, regenerative production refers to an approach to managing agroecosystems that provides fibers and materials – be it through agriculture, aquaculture, or forestry – in ways that create positive outcomes for nature. These outcomes include, but are not limited to, healthy and stable soils, improved local biodiversity, improved air and water quality, and higher levels of carbon sequestration. They can be achieved through a variety of context-dependent practices and can together help regenerate degraded ecosystems and build resilience on farms and in surrounding landscapes. Farmers may draw on several different schools of thought – such as regenerative agriculture, restorative aquaculture, agroecology, organic, permaculture, agroforestry, and conservation agriculture – to help them apply the most appropriate set of practices to drive regenerative outcomes in their managed agroecosystems."
"Desserto produces vegan leather made out of Mexican nopal cactus. Just like cow and synthetic leather, cactus leather can be used for manufacturing clothes, shoes, bags, and furniture, but without altering natural landscapes to support production. The nopal cactus is native to the state of Zacatecas and has a symbiotic relationship with other local species, as well as acting as a natural carbon sink. Desserto grows their cacti without chemical inputs and using a perennial model, such that only the mature leaves of the cactus plant are harvested each time. Part of this harvest is transformed into a range of vegan leather products developed with partner companies, such as H&M, Fossil and designer Karl Lagerfeld, and the remainder is used in the food industry for maximum utilisation."
"MUD Jeans was founded on a firm belief in the circular economy and a desire to demonstrate to the big players of the fashion world that cycling clothing is possible and profitable. Currently, MUD Jeans’ garments use up to 40% post-consumer recycled cotton, derived from discarded jeans. The remaining cotton is GOTS certified, meaning that their suppliers growing the fibres in Turkey avoid the use of pesticides and insecticides and are able to reduce water usage by 88%. Moreover, the company uses safe chemicals and processes, and offers a subscription model so that repairs are free and users can swap their jeans for a new pair."
"Developed through a partnership between the Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA) and the H&M Foundation, the Green Machine uses a closed-loop system of water, heat, pressure and green chemicals to fully separate and recycle cotton and polyester blends into new fibres. The goal of the partnership was achieved by finding a commercially viable method to recycle blend textiles at scale, in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner. The Green Machine’s output are long polyester fibres of good quality, which can be used to make new garments, and cellulose powder, which can be used within the fashion industry and beyond. In 2020, fashion brand Monki released the world’s first collection using fibres produced by the Green Machine."
"Renewcell’s recycling technology dissolves cellulose fibres like cotton from discarded garments and transforms them into Circulose® pulp, preventing textiles from becoming waste. This pulp can then be used to make viscose, lyocell or other types of man-made cellulosic fibres, reducing the demand for virgin raw materials. In order to scale up and expand their impact, Renewcell is developing partnerships with key players in the fashion industry like H&M Group and viscose manufacturer Tangshan Sanyo and securing new funding. For instance, in June 2021, the European Investment Bank lent Renewcell up to EUR 30.75 million to build its first commercial-scale factory in Sundsvall, Sweden, which will be able to produce 60,000 tonnes of Circulose per year."
"Founded to tackle the pollution and waste arising from fashion’s linear model that has a heavy toll on biodiversity, Infinited Fiber Company makes use of discarded cellulosic textiles to produce new Infinna™ fibres. These upcycled fibres have been tried and tested in the making of denim, single jersey, French terry and lightweight wovens, and the company is exploring other potential applications. In its June 2021 financing round, Infinited Fiber secured EUR 30 million from investors, including adidas, H&M Group and Sateri. This funding will help expand the company’s existing pilots and scale up production by building its first factory. Expected to be operational in 2024, the new factory will have an annual production capacity of 30,000 tonnes, which is enough fibre to produce roughly 100 million T-shirts from Infinna™ using post-consumer textile waste as feedstock."
"When FARFETCH was founded in 2007, one of the key parts of it’s vision was to better match supply and demand of luxury fashion, and therefore help tackle the fashion industry’s overproduction problem. Since then, the company has expanded its products and services to enable users in over 190 countries and territories to access luxury fashion in different ways. It has also started to decouple its business model from making more new products. For example, users have the possibility to purchase pre-owned clothing and accessories, prolong the use of their shoes and handbags through Farfetch Fix, or  resell them through Farfetch Second Life. Through these and other initiatives, FARFETCH aims to achieve its “circular > linear” goal of becoming more circular than linear by 2030 – with more than 50% of all the products it deals with to be recycled, upcycled, pre-owned, re-sold, donated or repaired."
"thredUP is a managed resale marketplace that makes it easier for people to sell unwanted clothes, meaning garments are kept in use for longer. By facilitating this increase in utilisation rates, the company can reduce the need for extracting virgin natural resources, whilst preventing incineration and landfilling. This ultimately avoids the negative impacts on biodiversity associated with the manufacturing and disposal of garments. Sellers send in their clothes via free postage, and the company sorts, selects, and lists them for sale on its e-commerce platform. The platform inventory includes more than 35,000 brands that are sold at a fraction of their original price. In 2021, thredUP reached a valuation of more than USD 1 billion."
"Jeanologia’s G2-Dynamic technology aims to provide an alternative to conventional fabric finishing, known for being particularly harmful to biodiversity due to its significant use of toxic chemicals, water, and energy. Instead, G2 Dynamic uses ozone for fabric finishing: taking air from the atmosphere, converting it into ozone, and using it to create colour degradation effects before being transformed back into oxygen. The desired results can be achieved in less time with this technology, which can result in resource and economic savings. Already, 35 fabric manufacturers across the globe have incorporated this Jeanologia machine into their production process, most of them being used for the finishing of denim."
"In order to tackle the pollution and water use of conventional dyeing, chemical company Archroma has developed EarthColors, a palette of dyes made from upcycled agricultural by-products. This alternative to oil-based dyes can be used in the dyeing of cellulose-based fibres. Archroma’s EarthColors received a Platinum Level Cradle2Cradle material health certificate and is also compliant with industry standards like Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemical (ZDHC), bluesign® and Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS). EarthColors dyes have already been used in collections released by Patagonia, Esprit and Ternua, among others brands."
"DyeCoo developed a technology that uses zero water to dye textiles, a process that is otherwise often associated with the generation of toxic wastewater. Instead of water, DyeCoo’s innovation makes use of carbon dioxide as a solvent in a closed-loop system. Additionally, no process chemicals are needed, reducing the amount of chemicals used in comparison to conventional dyeing methods. While the capital investment in the equipment is higher than for conventional dyeing, the company reports it can reduce operating costs due to the short batch cycles, the efficient dye use, and the avoidance of wastewater treatments. The technology can also reduce health and safety risks by minimising worker exposure to toxic chemicals."
"Colorifix, a UK-based biotech company, aims to eliminate the negative impacts on biodiversity and human health caused by conventional dyeing textile dyeings. The Colorifix dyeing process moves away from toxic petrochemicals and other harmful substances. Instead, they have developed an entirely biology-based process to produce, deposit, and fix pigments onto textiles. Via online DNA sequencing, they can identify and replicate the colour information found in a living organism such as an animal, plant or microbe. They then insert that information into a non-pathogenic microbe. Using renewable feedstocks such as sugars, yeasts, and plant by-products, they grow these microorganisms that can not only produce the desired colour but also transfer it onto clothing with zero harmful substances and a fraction of the water and energy necessary in conventional dyeing."
"Forchem reports that their products have lower carbon footprints compared to the fossil-based materials they replace. For example, they note that their distilled tall oil (DTO) product creates a mere 10% of the emissions of the soybean oil it replaces, while their tall oil rosin (TOR) has only 9% of the emissions of its gum rosin substitute. By enabling materials to be produced with significantly lower carbon emissions, Forchem is able to benefit biodiversity through helping address climate change, a key driver of biodiversity loss."
"By using only recycled fibres wherever possible and actively working to rebuild biodiversity in their forestry holdings, the firm is moving closer to eliminating waste and pollution and regenerating nature. Moreover, other circular strategies and innovations can tackle other drivers of biodiversity loss like climate change and pollution. For instance, rethinking the design of ECOWipes’ packaging allowed for a reduction in the amount of material needed, consequently reducing carbon emissions by 10% per packaging item."
"Continuous cover forestry approaches allow production sites to maintain forest structure at all times, and thereby enable continued habitat provision for a number of forest-dwelling species. One study on boreal production forests in Fennoscandia found that these benefits were particularly notable for species reliant on deciduous trees and mature forest structure in forests managed with this approach, compared to those managed with conventional rotation forestry. With the same study having noted that these approaches could lead to higher carbon sequestration than rotation forestry, continuous cover forestry can also offer benefits to addressing climate change, a key driver of biodiversity loss."
"Klabin has been monitoring the biodiversity in its managed areas and has registered an increase in the overall number of species. The Santa Catarina unit, for example, provides habitats for 136 species that are considered endangered, while 78 species new to the area have also been identified. Their forest management practices and efforts towards biodiversity have shown that it is possible to cultivate timber products in an area while at the same time enhancing biodiversity."
"In 2020, through their circular economy actions, including ECOFIT™, recycling, and take-back programmes, Schneider Electric avoided 157,000 metric tonnes of primary resource consumption, preventing all the negative impacts from the extraction and energy-intensive processing of those materials."
"According to Natura, the 'standing forest' economy has preserved 2 million hectares of rainforest from being cut down, while also providing more profits to local communities. One example is the ucuuba tree, a formerly endangered species that was traditionally cut down to supply timber for broomsticks and beams. By selling the seeds of ucuuba for cosmetic uses instead, a farmer can earn three times more while preserving the forest for future harvests. The possibility of making more profit from the forest encourages their owners to manage the land more regeneratively, enabling more species to thrive within the managed areas."
"By making use of local, existing materials, this Danish development reduced the need for virgin material extraction and processing — hence limiting its impact on natural resource overexploitation and climate change, two of the key drivers of biodiversity loss. Additionally, the design for flexibility approach taken for interior spaces will help keep the buildings in use for longer, even under changing requirements."
"The circular economy approach to retaining and reusing as much of the existing frame and façade as possible saved 3,300m2  of limestone, 35,000 tonnes of concrete and 1,900 tonnes of steel. By doing so, the project avoided the impacts on biodiversity of extracting and processing such amounts of virgin resources. This approach also minimised the carbon footprint of the redevelopment, hence reducing its contribution to climate change - one of the key drivers of biodiversity loss. Compared to a typical new build alternative, the building has been estimated to achieve a 54% carbon saving in construction and operation, equivalent to the annual energy consumption of over 10,000 UK homes."
"Villa Welpeloo’s use of salvaged instead of virgin materials displaced the need for further natural resource extraction, processing, and disposal. Reusing existing materials minimized the construction’s contribution to the key direct drivers of biodiversity loss, such as climate change and overexploitation of natural resources."
"Using hemp instead of concrete as a renewable, low-carbon material allowed for the Flat House to reduce its dependency on the extraction of finite resources like sand and gravel, which are associated with detrimental effects on biodiversity. The renewable materials and offsite construction methods used allowed to radically reduce the building’s embodied carbon. Moreover, hemp captures carbon as it grows, absorbing it from our atmosphere and locking it into biomass. As a result, the project is estimated to have negative annual emissions of –2.32 kgCO2/m²."
"Using timber instead of concrete as a renewable, low-carbon material allowed for the Believe in Better Building to reduce its dependency on the extraction of finite resources like sand and gravel, which has been associated with detrimental effects to biodiversity. The structure locks in 1,242 tonnes of CO2, even after discounting the 200 tonnes of emissions associated with manufacturing and transporting the timber from Austria. This is equivalent to 12 years of regulated operational carbon or 6 years of total operational carbon."
"The adaptive reuse approach retained 68% of the building’s structure, which reduced the need for virgin material extraction and retained a part of the tower’s embodied CO2 equivalent to 10,000 flights from Sydney to Melbourne. In doing so, the renovation was able to reduce its contribution to the overexploitation of natural resources and to climate change, thereby minimising the project’s impact on biodiversity."
"By promoting a compact urban environment where biodiversity is integrated, Singapore’s development has been able to leave room for nature within and beyond its built-up area. Singapore is home to an estimated 23,000–28,000 species of terrestrial organisms and 12,000–17,000 marine organisms."
"MIWA’s refill-on-the-go system can reduce packaging waste by 90% if customers bring their own reusable container, reducing the potential impacts on biodiversity associated with packaging waste disposal or leakage. Furthermore, a general Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) performed by the University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague showed that the MIWA system can reduce the overall negative environmental impact by up to 71% in comparison to conventional food distribution in disposable packaging, reducing the pressures on global biodiversity."
"Every tablet avoids the use of a single-use plastic bottle, reducing the potential impacts on biodiversity of it being sent to landfill, incinerated or leaking into the environment. Moreover, by delivering the product in a solid format, Everdrop’s tabs can save up to 95% of transport greenhouse gas emissions, drastically minimising the contribution to climate change, a key driver of biodiversity loss."
"Ooho eliminates the need for plastic-based sachets that could potentially leak into the environment and harm biodiversity. For example, approximately 36,000 plastic-based items were eliminated at the 2019 London Marathon trial and 46,000 sauce sachets were eliminated during an eight week trial with ten London restaurants. The blob can be eaten or composted and, if in the very worst-case scenario it ends up in the environment, it will take less than six weeks to biodegrade. Additionally, in contrast with fossil fuel-based plastics, the material is based on seaweed, a renewable resource that has the potential to regenerate coastal environments and capture carbon."
"Between 2016 and 2019, Kecipir operations eliminated 6 tonnes of low quality, single-use plastics (like plastic bags and styrofoam trays). If Kecipir was to capture just 1% of the Indonesian market, they estimate 4,400 tons (~3990 tonnes) of single-use plastic leakage into the ocean would be avoided on an annual basis. In 2019, the model was also estimated to reduce the amount of food wasted by 132 tonnes per year, as products are delivered locally, directly after being harvested. Other threats to biodiversity that are minimised thanks to their circular business model include a reduction in transport emissions, as products travel a maximum of 60 km, and the avoidance of refrigeration-related emissions, as delivery time is less than 24 hours from farmer to consumer."
"One JOI tub is estimated to eliminate seven cartons; one pail, 60 cartons, reducing the need for and impacts on biodiversity of material extraction and processing. Moreover, the mono-material rigid packaging used by JOI has a higher chance of being recycled than common multi-material alternatives used to package nut milk, reducing the potential for leakage into the environment and the need for virgin material extraction. JOI’s format is also able to minimise transport emissions as it reduces weight and storage space: one truckload of JOI is said to be equivalent to five truckloads of plant-based milk in cartons."
"During their one-year pilot in partnership with Unilever, some of Algramo’s customers refilled their detergent bottles 15 times, with each refill eliminating the need for an HDPE bottle and its associated impacts on biodiversity, whilst keeping the original refillable bottle in use and out of the environment."
"In 2020,  the “Action Plan for the Northeastern Black Soil Conservation (2020-2025)” set the target to extend conservation agriculture to 140 million hectare of arable land (i.e. 70% of total arable land in Northeastern China), making it the mainstream approach."
"By leveraging the characteristics of traditional corn and incorporating the husks into his designs, Laposse encourages family farmers to reintroduce native seeds that were being gradually replaced by hybrid corn varieties to supply international markets. These farmers are going back to traditional agriculture that relies on natural-, instead of chemical-, fertilisers and uses the best seeds for the next crops, thus eliminating the pollution that erodes soils and is harmful for biodiversity."
"In 25 years of operations, Guayakí has regenerated 80,000 hectares of South American Atlantic rainforest, having planted 7,200 trees. This has restored biological corridors and over 900 species (plants, mammals and birds) have been observed in harvested and cultivated areas, including rare and endangered species. As a side benefit of regeneration, every year, 972,600 million tons of CO2 are sequestered. Organic, shade-grown yerba mate has also shown to be more resilient and abundant than that which is grown with the conventional method under the sun, in monoculture."
"Making better use of underused local fish stocks like roach can help reduce pressures on overexploited marine stocks like tuna, as well as on birds, bycatch and the seabed, a precondition for allowing marine ecosystems to regenerate. This is equally true in bodies of freshwater, from which the wild fish is harvested. By managing and using this stock below the rate of replenishment, it is possible to tackle the excess phosphorous and nitrogen load in local freshwater bodies through a process known as biomanipulation, which helps restore much of the biodiversity that is currently threatened by eutrophication both in freshwater bodies and the Baltic Sea."
"Brilliant Planet reports that for every ton of algae grown, they're able to capture 2.8 tons of CO2, thereby helping tackle climate change - one of the key drivers of biodiversity loss. The cultivation is also able to improve the quality of the sea water in which it is grown, de-acidifying it and helping provide healthier habitats for various species.
By offering a direct substitute for fish - as it contains all of the same health-beneficial proteins, essential amino acids, Omega 3 oils, EPA and DHA - the algae grown can also help address the issue of global fish population overexploitation by providing an attractive substitute. For each ton of algae produced, one ton of fish, and all of the feed required to rear them, can be replaced. If this substitution is applied to the production of fishmeal, the company reports that one ton of their algae can replace 3 tons of wild fish from being caught."
"FoodFlow shares their learnings, and invites others to replicate solutions across East Africa with the aim of enhancing food security and farmer incomes throughout the region."
"Through enabling the upcycling of food that would have otherwise been lost and working to empower local communities, Agricycle has been able to divert over 74,500 kg of food from being wasted. As such, their operations are able to help reduce the pressures on food production - and all its associated negative impacts on biodiversity - to meet growing demand."
"Through their sourcing decisions, Community Grains helps encourage the farmers they work with to increase their on-farm biodiversity by growing more diverse grain varieties. In addition to including multiple grain types in their product portfolios, Community Grains also creates demand for heritage grain varieties, which enhances crop genetic diversity, and enables farmers to benefit from the cultivation of these more resilient and adaptable crops. At the same time, by asking the members of their value chain to report on their impact on factors influencing biodiversity such as land quality and water use, and making consumers aware of these benefits, Community Grains helps create stronger demand for regeneratively grown grain varieties, thus increasing the likelihood of more farmers adopting such methods in the future."
"The regenerative production approaches of Rizoma Agro have enabled its farms to approximately double their water retention capacity and sequester up to 41 tonnes of carbon per hectare each year (in just the first year after shifting to regenerative production, levels of soil organic matter on two farms increased from 2.7% to 3.3% and from 1.3% to 2.5%). Taken together, these effects can create healthier habitats on and around the cultivation areas for both above- and below-ground biodiversity, while helping reduce pressures on key biodiversity loss drivers such as climate change, and natural resource overexploitation."
"GreenWave’s regenerative ocean farms can turn barren patches of ocean into thriving reefs, attracting biodiversity and rebuilding degraded coastal ecosystems. The farms can provide storm surge protection for coastal communities and require zero inputs: no fresh water, fertilizer, land, or feed. Studies have also shown that in general, growing seaweed can enhance water quality and absorb nutrient run-off, with the production of 500 million tons (~ 453.6 million tonnes) of seaweed having been estimated to be able to assimilate 10 million tons (~ 9.1 million tonnes) of nitrogen from seawater, equaling some 30% of the nitrogen estimated to enter the ocean. At the same time, these actions offer substantial carbon sequestration potential: growing seaweed in less than 5% of U.S. waters could absorb 135 million tons of carbon (~450 million tonnes of CO2)."
"Kering has through its Biodiversity Strategy committed to converting 1 million hectares of farms and rangelands in its supply chain landscapes into regenerative agriculture by 2025. In order to achieve this, the fashion group has partnered with Conservation International to launch the Regenerative Fund for Nature, which will assist producers explore and transition to practices with regenerative outcomes."
"Early life cycle assessments have shown that Desserto's cactus leather has a 500% lower eutrophication impact compared to animal leather and 10% lower than synthetic leather (polyurethane). Their organic plantations can absorb 8,100 tons of CO2 per year, which makes the 14 acre farm carbon negative, thereby helping tackle a key driver of biodiversity loss: climate change."
"MUD jeans reports that one of their items emits 7.14 kg CO2e (versus the industry average of 23.45 kg CO2e), uses 581 litres of water (versus the industry average of 7,000 litres) and requires 5 m2 of land per year. Through an innovative method for measuring their biodiversity impact, on average, a pair of MUD Jeans has been estimated to potentially affect 0,000000203 species per year. Overall, applying a combination of circular economy practices has allowed them to achieve an impact on biodiversity 51% lower than the industry standard."
The Green Machine turns textile products that would otherwise be landfilled or burned into new fibres – reducing the impacts on biodiversity associated with disposal and new virgin material production.
"Compared to producing fibres from virgin cotton or forestry products, Renewcell states that its fibre production process saves large amounts of water, manages chemicals in a closed-loop, zero-leakage environment, requires zero land for fibre cultivation, and stores rather than emits CO2."
"Infinited Fiber’s innovative technology diverts textile waste from landfills or incinerators and turns them into new fibres. In doing so, they are reducing the impacts on biodiversity associated with polluting disposal methods and resource-intensive virgin fibre production. By keeping existing fibres in use, they displace the need for more land cultivation, leaving room for biodiversity."
"By connecting unused clothes to new customers, thereby increasing the number of uses of existing garments, FARFETCH services can reduce the pressures on biodiversity associated with the manufacturing and disposal of new products. FARFETCH estimates that one pre-owned purchase saves, on average, 1kg of waste, 3,040 litres of water, and 22kg of CO2.*"
"Until now, thredUP has processed 125 million unique secondhand items, avoiding the emission of about 500,000 tonnes of CO2e, saving over 16 billion litres of water,* and reducing other pressures on biodiversity associated with the manufacturing and disposal of garments."
"Jeanologia reports that its G2-Dynamic ozone finishing technology can offer savings of up to 95% of water, 100% chemicals, 80% energy, and 40% of carbon emissions during the fabric finishing process. Minimising these pressures can reduce the impacts on biodiversity otherwise associated with fabric finishing."
"Archoma reports its EarthColors innovation is able to reduce water consumption by up to 86%, CO2 emissions by up to 50%, and chemical usage by up to 54%, depending on the dyeing technique. Such reductions can alleviate the overexploitation of natural resources, the contribution to climate change, and the generation of pollution associated with conventional oil-based dyeing processes."
"One of DyeCoo’s machines can process 800 tons of polyester per year, effectively saving 32 million litres of water, avoiding the use of 160 tons of chemicals and completely eliminating the release of wastewater into the natural environment."
"Through Africa’s first Industrial Symbiosis Programme, manufacturing companies exchange under-used resources that would otherwise become waste while generating revenue, creating jobs and cutting emissions."
"One-acre farm is a highly profitable, mixed-farm near Lake Victoria in Uganda, East Africa. The small farm was designed by farmer and veterinarian Dr. Emma Naluyima."
"Agricycle works with smallholder farmers around the world to upcycle food that would otherwise be wasted. The company manufactures and distributes solar dehydrator technologies that enable food to be preserved for longer, purchase the resulting products directly from cooperatives, and create brands to sell these products in global markets."
Safi Organics is a decentralised manufacturer of fertilisers operating in a rice-growing area of North Kenya. Safi Organics collects discarded rice husks and transforms them into a nutrient and carbon-rich organic biochar fertiliser called Safi Sarvi.
"Insectipro and Sanergy are both based in and around the city of Nairobi, Kenya. Both companies harness, using slightly different approaches, the remarkable metabolic power of insects to transform organic waste into revenue-earning products:"
"Dr. Bronner's is an American personal care company that relies on a high volume of agricultural raw ingredients to manufacture its soaps, toothpastes, and lotions. Many of these ingredients, in particular palm oil, are sourced from tropical areas, with global supply chains that are commonly associated with destructive environmental practices and the exploitation of local communities. After many years of unsuccessfully searching for an ethical and nature-positive source of palm oil, Dr. Bronner's decided to build one on its own."
