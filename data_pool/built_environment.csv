This means the building can be taken apart simply by unscrewing the components, which can then be reused in other projects. The office is also conceived as a materials bank, with all its materials monitored using a public online repository so they can more easily be reused in the future. Built in 2019, the building achieved a BREEAM Outstanding Certificate for its environmental, social, and economic sustainability thanks to, among other factors, making use of sustainable materials and natural light, and carefully regulating its climate."

The structure locks in 1,242 tonnes of CO2, even after discounting the 200 tonnes of emissions associated with manufacturing and transporting the timber from Austria. This is equivalent to 12 years of regulated operational carbon or 6 years of total operational carbon."

Moreover, hemp captures carbon as it grows, absorbing it from our atmosphere and locking it into biomass. As a result, the project is estimated to have negative annual emissions of –2.32 kgCO2/m²."

By doing so, the project avoided the impacts on biodiversity of extracting and processing such amounts of virgin resources. This approach also minimised the carbon footprint of the redevelopment, hence reducing its contribution to climate change - one of the key drivers of biodiversity loss. Compared to a typical new build alternative, the building has been estimated to achieve a 54% carbon saving in construction and operation, equivalent to the annual energy consumption of over 10,000 UK homes."
